## **Welcome to 'Record Days Survived'**
In this unique adventure, your goal is to keep track of how many consecutive days you can survive without succumbing to the dangers of the world.

Upon installing this mod, the day counter will be activated automatically upon entering a world. Each time the sun sets and a new dawn arises, the counter will increment.

However, you must not let your guard down, as a single mistake or a bad choice could result in your death. Don't worry, though, if that happens, you won't lose all your progress. On the contrary, upon dying, the mod will display a message showing your record of days lived before the fateful event, encouraging you to surpass yourself and reach new survival milestones.

Furthermore, with the command `record_report`, you can see how many days have elapsed and what your record is for surviving days.

Get ready to live a unique and thrilling experience with 'Record Days Survived.' Do you have what it takes to face the days and become a master of survival? Prove it and start your adventure right now!
